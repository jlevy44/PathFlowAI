Published in the Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium for Biocomputing 2020, Manuscript: https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb20/Levy.pdf

## Install

First, install [openslide](https://openslide.org/download/). Note: may need to install libiconv and shapely using conda. Will update with more installation information, please submit issues as well.

```sh
pip install pathflowai
install_apex
```

## Usage

```sh
pathflowai-preprocess -h
pathflowai-train_model -h
pathflowai-monitor -h
pathflowai-visualize -h
```

See [Wiki](https://github.com/jlevy44/PathFlowAI/wiki) for more information on setting up and running the workflow. Please submit feedback as issues and let me know if there is any trouble with installation and I am more than happy to provide advice and fixes.

Fig. 1. PathFlowAI Framework: a) Annotations and whole slide images are preprocessed in parallel using
Dask; b) Deep learning prediction model is trained on the model; c) Results are visualized; d) UMAP
embeddings provide diagnostics; e) SHAP framework is used to find important regions for the prediction

Fig. 2. Comparison of PathFlowAI to Preprocessing WSI in Series for: a) Preprocessing time, b) Storage
Space, c) Impact on the filesystem. The PathFlowAI method of parallel processing followed by
centralized storage saves both time and storage space

Fig. 4. Portal Classification Results: a) Darker tiles indicate a higher assigned probability of portal classification, b)
AUC-ROC curves for the test images that estimate overall accuracy given different sensitivity cutoffs, c) H&E patch
(left) with corresponding SHAP interpretations (right) for four patches; the probability value of portal classification
is shown, and on the SHAP value scale, red indicates regions that the model attributes to portal prediction, d) Model trained UMAP embeddings of patches colored by original portal coverage (area of patch covered by portal) as judged
by pathologist and visualization of individual patches
